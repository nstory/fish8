# Fish8

## Notes on the Fish Shell Language

#### Reading a Binary File
I couldn't figure out a good way to read in a binary file. The [read command](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/read.html) seemed to choke on the NULL bytes as did `set myvar (cat file.bin)`

#### Arrays are indexed starting at 1
This is painful, at least when writing a program like Fish8. According to the docs, there's a good reason for this, however:

> List indices start at 1 in fish, not 0 like in other languages. This is because it requires less subtracting of 1 and many common Unix tools like seq work better with it (seq 5 prints 1 to 5, not 0 to 5).
